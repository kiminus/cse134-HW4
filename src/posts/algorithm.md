# Optimization Algorithm
## Introduction
This is a simple example of optimization algorithm. The goal is to find the minimum value of a function. The function is defined as:
$$ f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6 $$
The algorithm is implemented in Python. The algorithm is a simple hill climbing algorithm. The algorithm starts at a random point and iteratively move to the direction of the steepest descent. The algorithm stops when the change in the function value is less than a threshold. The algorithm is implemented in Python. The code is shown below:
```python 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
