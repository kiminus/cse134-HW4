# Chapter 8: Imperfect and Perfect Competition

## **1. Identify the profit-maximizing quantity for an imperfectly competitive firm**
### **Problem:**
A monopolist faces the demand curve:
\[ P = 100 - 2Q \]
and has a total cost function:
\[ TC = 20Q + 100 \]
What quantity should the monopolist produce to maximize profit?

### **Solution:**
- **Revenue Function:**
  \[ TR = P \times Q = (100 - 2Q)Q = 100Q - 2Q^2 \]
- **Marginal Revenue (MR):**
  \[ MR = \frac{dTR}{dQ} = 100 - 4Q \]
- **Marginal Cost (MC):**
  \[ MC = \frac{dTC}{dQ} = 20 \]
- **Profit Maximization Condition:**
  \[ MR = MC \]
  \[ 100 - 4Q = 20 \]
  \[ 4Q = 80 \]
  \[ Q^* = 20 \]

### **Answer:**
The profit-maximizing quantity is **20 units**.

## **2. Identify the profit-maximizing price for an imperfectly competitive firm**
### **Problem:**
Using the demand curve from Problem 1, what price should the monopolist charge to maximize profit?

### **Solution:**
- Given demand function:
  \[ P = 100 - 2Q \]
- Plug in the profit-maximizing quantity \( Q^* = 20 \):
  \[ P = 100 - 2(20) = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

### **Answer:**
The profit-maximizing price is **$60$**.

## **3. Identify loss to consumers/gains to producers and DWL in an imperfectly competitive market, relative to perfect competition**
### **Problem:**
Assume that in perfect competition, the market price would be $40$ and quantity would be $30$. Calculate:
1. **Consumer Surplus (CS) under monopoly**
2. **Producer Surplus (PS) under monopoly**
3. **Deadweight Loss (DWL)**

### **Solution:**
- **Consumer Surplus (CS) under Monopoly:**
  \[ CS = \frac{1}{2} (100 - 60) \times 20 = \frac{1}{2} (40 \times 20) = 400 \]
- **Producer Surplus (PS) under Monopoly:**
  \[ PS = (P - MC) \times Q = (60 - 20) \times 20 = 800 \]
- **Deadweight Loss (DWL):**
  \[ DWL = \frac{1}{2} (30 - 20) \times (60 - 40) = \frac{1}{2} (10 \times 20) = 100 \]

### **Answer:**
1. **Consumer Surplus:** $400$
2. **Producer Surplus:** $800$
3. **Deadweight Loss:** $100$

## **4. Identify the profit-maximizing quantity for a perfectly competitive firm**
### **Problem:**
A firm in perfect competition has a cost function:
\[ TC = 5Q^2 + 10Q + 50 \]
The market price is given as **$40$**. Find the profit-maximizing quantity.

### **Solution:**
- **Marginal Cost (MC):**
  \[ MC = \frac{dTC}{dQ} = 10Q + 10 \]
- **Profit Maximization Condition:**
  \[ P = MC \]
  \[ 40 = 10Q + 10 \]
  \[ 10Q = 30 \]
  \[ Q^* = 3 \]

### **Answer:**
The profit-maximizing quantity is **3 units**.

## **5. Identify the profit-maximizing price for a perfectly competitive firm**
### **Problem:**
Using the same setup from Problem 4, what is the optimal price a perfectly competitive firm should charge?

### **Solution:**
- In perfect competition, **Price = Market Price**.
- Given **Market Price = $40$**.

### **Answer:**
The firm should charge **$40$ per unit**.

---

## **6. Identify the profit-maximizing quantity for a firm that can perfectly price discriminate**
### **Problem:**
A monopolist faces the demand curve:
\[ P = 120 - 3Q \]
and has a marginal cost of **$30$** per unit. What is the profit-maximizing quantity if the firm can perfectly price discriminate?

### **Solution:**
- Perfect price discrimination means the firm sells each unit at the maximum price consumers are willing to pay.
- **Profit-maximizing condition:**
  \[ P = MC \]
  \[ 120 - 3Q = 30 \]
  \[ 3Q = 90 \]
  \[ Q^* = 30 \]

### **Answer:**
The firm will produce **30 units**.

---

## **7. Identify the price that a firm that can perfectly price discriminate would charge**
### **Problem:**
Using the demand function from Problem 6, what prices will the firm charge under perfect price discrimination?

### **Solution:**
- The firm charges each consumer their willingness to pay.
- The highest price is when \( Q = 1 \):
  \[ P = 120 - 3(1) = 117 \]
- The lowest price is at **Q = 30** (where MR = MC):
  \[ P = 120 - 3(30) = 30 \]

### **Answer:**
The firm charges **each consumer a different price, from $117$ for the first unit to $30$ for the last unit**.

---

## **8. Determine the effect of perfect price discrimination on total surplus, consumer surplus, and producer surplus**
### **Problem:**
What happens to consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus under perfect price discrimination compared to a single-price monopoly?

### **Solution:**
- **Consumer Surplus (CS) = 0** (since all surplus is extracted by the firm).
- **Producer Surplus (PS) = Total Surplus** (all value is captured by the firm).
- **Total Surplus (TS) remains the same as in perfect competition**, since there is no deadweight loss.

### **Answer:**
1. **Consumer Surplus = 0**
2. **Producer Surplus = Total Surplus**
3. **Total Surplus remains unchanged** compared to perfect competition.
